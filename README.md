# About

This program is written in C++ and the first version will not be graphical
If the representative program and support are many, I will make this program graphic so that users can easily get recoil in their game

When you hold down the click button or the mouse click button, this program lowers a few pixels depending on the recoil so that the mouse does not move up too much.

Another type of this recoil catcher is that when you hold "W" and move forward, the weapon will take recoil, and again the program will take this recoil with the previous method.
